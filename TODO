 - Add credentials for MQTT server login.

 - There's something going on I don't understand which often corrupts
   $rx when the client disconnects. As a result, $rx is generated
   fresh for each client, but is updated from the previous YAML save,
   if that's available. Fix this.

 - Make it figure out that the client has disconnect much more quickly
   than it does not.  Often takes thirty seconds to figure that out.

 - Make it handle more than one client per process. Running a full
   daemon per client is wasteful.

 - Fully 'daemonize' the code.

 - Catch more potential exceptions and do something smart with them
   (ie, make everything a little more robust).
